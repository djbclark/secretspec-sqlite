description: How the language SDKs are built, packaged, and released, and which platforms each one supports
---

SecretSpec ships SDKs for Rust, Python, Go, Ruby, Node.js/TypeScript, Haskell,
PHP, C#, and Swift (0.18+). This page is for contributors: how the SDKs are put
together, how each one is packaged and released, which platforms each artifact
covers, and what to update when adding a platform or a new SDK. For the
user-facing architecture and API, see the [SDK overview](/sdk/overview).

:::note[Native library name]
Starting with SecretSpec 0.20, the embedded C ABI is named `libsecretspec` and
ships `libsecretspec.*`/`secretspec.dll` artifacts. Releases through 0.19 used
the component name `secretspec-ffi` and `secretspec_ffi` artifact stem.
:::

## One resolver, many packages

All resolution logic lives in the `secretspec` Rust crate. The SDKs reach it
two ways:

- **Through the C ABI** (`libsecretspec`, which builds a `cdylib` for dynamic
  loading and a `staticlib` for embedding): Ruby (mkmf extension statically
  links the archive), Go (purego `dlopen` of the cdylib, or cgo against the
  archive with `-tags static`), Haskell (GHC FFI against the archive), C#
  (P/Invoke against per-runtime cdylibs in the NuGet package), Swift (0.18+;
  Clang C import from an XCFramework), and PHP's `ext-ffi` fallback (runtime
  `dlopen` of the cdylib).
- **As an embedded extension**: Python ([pyo3](https://pyo3.rs/)), Node.js
  ([napi-rs](https://napi.rs/)), and PHP's preferred backend
  ([ext-php-rs](https://github.com/davidcole1340/ext-php-rs)) compile the
  resolver directly into a language-native extension module.

Every SDK exchanges the same JSON request/response with the core, and the
cross-language conformance suite (`conformance/`, run by
`.github/workflows/sdks.yml` on every PR) asserts they all reduce the same
inputs to the same result.

This embedded boundary remains supported. SecretSpec 0.20+'s
[IPC architecture](/reference/ipc-architecture) adds an explicit broker option
for applications that cannot or should not link the resolver and its provider
graph. Its [Secret Resolution Protocol](/reference/client-protocol) is a
versioned process boundary; it does not replace `libsecretspec` or silently
change how existing SDK packages run. See
[Implementing SecretSpec IPC](/development/ipc-implementation) for the 0.20+
component layout and conformance requirements.

Package versions for the non-Rust SDKs are not hand-edited: release workflows
run `scripts/sync-sdk-versions.sh`, which stamps the Cargo workspace version
into every package manifest.

## Packaging workflows

Each SDK has a dedicated distribution workflow that builds artifacts per
platform and publishes on a version tag:

| SDK | Package | Workflow |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Rust | `secretspec` on crates.io (source) | `publish.yml` |
| Python | `secretspec` wheels on PyPI | `python-wheels.yml` |
| Node.js | `secretspec` + per-platform packages on npm | `node-addon.yml` |
| Go | Go module (source) + `libsecretspec` release assets | `go-embed.yml`, `go-static.yml`, `ffi-build.yml` |
| Ruby | `secretspec` platform gems on RubyGems | `ruby-gems.yml` |
| C# | `Cachix.SecretSpec` on NuGet | `dotnet-package.yml` |
| Swift (0.18+) | SwiftPM source package + XCFramework release asset | `swift-package.yml` |
| PHP | Composer package (source) + prebuilt extension binaries and `libsecretspec` release assets | `php-ext.yml`, `ffi-build.yml` |
| Haskell | `secretspec` on Hackage (source) | `haskell-build.yml` |

## Platform support

Platforms each released artifact covers. Windows support for the Python wheel,
the Ruby gem, and the PHP extension binaries is added in SecretSpec 0.17.

| SDK | Linux x64 | Linux arm64 | macOS Intel | macOS Apple silicon | Windows x64 | Windows arm64 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Rust (source crate) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Python | ✓ | ✓ | — | ✓ | ✓ (0.17+) | — |
| Node.js | ✓ | ✓ | — | ✓ | ✓ | — |
| Go | ✓ | ✓ | — | ✓ | ✓ | — |

Notes:

- Most Linux binary artifacts build inside manylinux_2_28 containers so they
  run on any distro with glibc >= 2.28 (the Ruby Linux gem still links the
  build runner's glibc; a baseline toolchain there is a tracked follow-up).
  The keyring provider uses a Rust-native D-Bus transport on Linux and does not
  require system libdbus.
- Hackage distributes source only; the Haskell column records which platforms
  CI builds and tests, since users link `libsecretspec` themselves.
- The Swift package targets macOS 12+ only. Its XCFramework contains native
  Intel and Apple-silicon slices; mobile Apple platforms are intentionally out
  of scope for a development-workflow resolver that launches provider CLIs and
  reads desktop files and credential stores.
- The fully-static Go binary (`-tags static`, musl) is Linux x64 only.

## Why Swift uses the C ABI

Swift interoperates with C directly through Clang modules, and SwiftPM
distributes native Apple binaries as XCFramework binary targets. That fits the
existing `libsecretspec` boundary exactly: three ownership-audited C functions
carry one already-versioned JSON contract.

[UniFFI](https://mozilla.github.io/uniffi-rs/latest/) is a good default for a
new object-rich Rust API that needs generated Swift and Kotlin bindings. It
would be the wrong layer here: SecretSpec already has a deliberately narrow ABI
shared by several SDKs, and introducing UniFFI would create a second exported
ABI, generated Rust scaffolding, and another schema to version. The hand-written
Swift layer is limited to `Codable` request/response models and idiomatic errors;
resolution remains entirely in Rust.

`scripts/build-swift-xcframework.sh` changes Cargo's target-local dylib install
name to `@rpath`, merges the native slices into a universal dylib, adds the C
header and module map, and invokes
`xcodebuild -create-xcframework`. `swift-package.yml` builds each architecture
natively, tests the final universal artifact, computes SwiftPM's SHA-256
checksum, and attaches the ZIP to the GitHub release. See `RELEASE.md` for the
required pre-tag checksum step.

## Windows toolchains

Windows artifacts split across two Rust targets, and the split is load-bearing:

- **MSVC (`x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`)** for artifacts loaded by MSVC-built
  hosts: the CLI, the FFI cdylib, the Python wheel, the Node addon, the NuGet
  natives, and the PHP extension. PHP is the special case: PHP's Windows ABI
  uses the vectorcall calling convention, which stable Rust does not expose,
  so `php-ext.yml` builds that one artifact on nightly Rust (the same setup
  ext-php-rs's own CI uses). ext-php-rs downloads the PHP development pack
  matching the installed `php.exe` during the build.
- **MinGW (`x86_64-pc-windows-gnu`, declared in `rust-toolchain.toml`)** for
  artifacts linked by MinGW toolchains, which cannot consume MSVC `.lib`
  archives: the staticlib bundled in the Ruby gem (RubyInstaller's devkit) and
  the one the Haskell CI job links (GHC's bundled toolchain). Building it
  needs a MinGW C compiler for the archive's C dependencies (aws-lc-sys,
  SQLite, zstd) and NASM for aws-lc's assembly.

A `staticlib` does not carry its native link-time dependencies; consumers
capture them from `cargo rustc ... -- --print native-static-libs`. On
`windows-gnu` that list names import libraries that ship inside cargo registry
crates (`libwindows.*.a` from `windows_x86_64_gnu`, `libwinapi_*.a` from
`winapi-x86_64-pc-windows-gnu`) and exist in no MinGW distribution.
`scripts/copy-mingw-import-libs.sh` stages exactly the referenced ones next to
the archive — the Ruby gem bundles them in `vendor/`, the Haskell job points
GHC's linker at them.

## Linking through pkg-config (0.19+)

`libsecretspec/scripts/cinstall.sh PREFIX static|shared` uses
[cargo-c](https://github.com/lu-zero/cargo-c) to install one library type, the
header, and a `libsecretspec.pc` carrying its full link line. This lets
pkg-config consumers skip the `native-static-libs` capture above. Use separate
prefixes for the two modes: both metadata files use `-lsecretspec`, and the
linker prefers a shared library when both forms are present.

## Adding a platform to an SDK

1. Add the platform to the SDK's distribution workflow matrix, and make the
   publish job consume the new artifact.
2. Build natively on a runner of that platform where possible; the workflows
   deliberately avoid cross-compiling because the crate links system
   libraries.
3. Keep the artifact self-contained: vendor or statically link anything an end
   user's machine will not have (see the manylinux and MinGW import library
   notes above).
4. Smoke test in the same workflow: install or load the built artifact and
   call one function through it.
5. Update the platform table above, the [SDK overview](/sdk/overview) platform
   section, and label the platform with its target release (for example
   `(0.17+)`) until that release ships.
6. Add a user-facing CHANGELOG entry.

## Adding a new SDK

1. Create the binding crate/package as a workspace sibling
   (`secretspec-<lang>/`), thin: marshal the JSON envelope, expose the
   builder/resolve API mirroring the existing SDKs' vocabulary.
2. Wire the package manifest into `scripts/sync-sdk-versions.sh` so its
   version tracks the workspace.
3. Add the SDK to the conformance suite and to `.github/workflows/sdks.yml`.
4. Create a distribution workflow following an existing one
   (`ruby-gems.yml` and `python-wheels.yml` are the smallest), including
   publish-on-tag with trusted publishing where the registry supports it.
5. Document it: `docs/src/content/docs/sdk/<lang>.md`, the sidebar in
   `docs/astro.config.ts`, the [SDK overview](/sdk/overview), and the platform
   tables on this page and the overview.
6. Follow the same release-visibility rules as providers: label everything
   with the target version until the release ships (see
   [Adding Providers](/development/adding-providers)).

If the SDK offers broker mode (SecretSpec 0.20+), keep it an explicit backend choice and run the
IPC conformance suite in addition to the embedded SDK suite. Broker mode must
use the Rust `secretspec-ipc` client in Rust or bind the pure-C
`libsecretspec-ipc` client in non-Rust SDKs. The wire protocol remains canonical
for independent implementations, but supported language bindings must not
create a different request format or another client state machine. CI runs both
clients through the same conformance and differential cases.
